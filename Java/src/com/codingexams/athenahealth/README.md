 <h3>Problem: Featured Products</h3>
 
An e-commerce site tracks the purchases made each day. The product that is purchased the most one day is the featured product for the following day. If there is a tie for the product purchased most frequently, those product names are ordered alphabetically ascending and the last name in the list is chosen.
